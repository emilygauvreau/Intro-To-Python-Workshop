# Intro-To-Python-Workshop

The following documents were created for a workshop hosted in partnership with McWiCS and STEMCanada.
The Google Colaboratory Notebook written by myself and co-host Nikita Patel outlines the major topics we deem essential in understanding the basics of Python. It follows the same structure and lay out as a Jupyter Notebook.

Using the Notebook structure was essential to our success because it allowed us to create headers with subsections making the code easier to refer back to. Our goal was to create a workshop and resources that would kick start their education journey with coding and could be used in the future as a "cheat sheet".

The Notebook style also allowed for individual code blocks that could be executed one at a time in order to understand the output from the previous section with examples. This allowed us to directly relate what we had spoken about to a relevant example with corresponding output.

Once we had covered these concepts, we worked through a program together to reinforce the concepts in an interactive manner. The idea we decided on was a Cafe Menu where the user would be prompted to choose an item from a menu, and by consequence, would be asked relevant questions (like coffee size for example). Once they finished ordering, the list of items they selected as well as the price would be returned. I then created two files, one that had a completed functioning program that would act as an answer key the students had access to when the activity was over, and another that had step-by-step instructions such that they could work through it independently or with us.

We gave the group the option to work independently or collaboratively and it was their decision to work together! This meant that they provided the answers that should be inputted and I typed it into the file if it was on track or otherwise explained how it may it be different from what we are looking for.

This hands on activity gave them the opportunity to test what they learned and ask questions they didn't even realize they had until they began to implement. For example, a student inquired how you even approach a problem of this sort and we discussed the benefit of using pseudocode to create outlines and to continuously ask yourself "How will I accomplish this requirement?".

The [Intro To Python Notebook](./IntroToPython-Notebook.ipynb) holds all of the concepts covered as well as the examples from the live workshop.

The [Cafe Menu Student Version](./CafeMenu-StudentVersion.py) holds the outline for the "fill-in-the-blanks" style program.

The [Cafe Menu Answer Key](./CafeMenu-AnswerKey.py) holds the answer key with extra functions to demonstrate how programs can be expanded to become more complex.

Enjoy!
